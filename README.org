Title: Two new algorithms for scientific applications of machine learning

Speaker: Toby Dylan HOCKING, https://tdhock.github.io/

Abstract: In the last few years, I have maintained active
collaborations with scientists who are not machine learning experts,
but who want to use machine learning algorithms for their data
analyses. In many scientific applications of machine learning, two
questions come up again and again. 
- Question 1. we have some data from one region (or time period), so
  if we use these data to train, will it work on a new region? (or
  time period) 
- Question 2. how do we deal with class imbalance?  
- Example A: forestry. When predicting forest properties based on
  objects in satellite images, if we train on one region (say
  Arizona), will it work in another? (California or Quebec) How to
  deal with the fact that some objects of interest (trees, burn) are
  only a small minority of data?
- Example B: medicine. When predicting autism diagnosis from other
  survey responses, if we train on one year of survey data (say 2019),
  will it work in another year? (say 2020) And can we combine the two
  years of data to get a better model? How to deal with the fact that
  autism represents only 3% of the total surveys? (97% of survey
  respondants did not have autism)
- For Question 1, we propose a new algorithm called SOAK
  (Same/Other/All K-fold Cross-Validation), which can be used to quantify the extent to
  which it is possible to predict on a given data subset, after training
  on Same/Other/All data subsets. https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08643 
- For Question 2, we propose a new differentiable loss function which
  can be used to optimize the ROC curve,

- I am a new professor at Universit√© de Sherbrooke since June 2024,
  and I am open to collaborative research projects / co-supervising
  students.
